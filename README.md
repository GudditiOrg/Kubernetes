Kubernetes

Containers and Docker: Understand the basics of containerization and how Docker is used to package applications and their dependencies into containers.

Kubernetes Architecture: Learn about the key components of Kubernetes, including the control plane (master nodes) and worker nodes (where containers run).

Pods: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes and can contain one or more tightly coupled containers. Learn about how to create and manage pods.

ReplicaSets and Deployments: These are used to manage the desired number of replicas of a pod and to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Services: Services provide a stable endpoint to access a set of pods. Learn about different types of services like ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.

Volumes: Understand how to manage persistent data using volumes, which allows data to survive container restarts.

ConfigMaps and Secrets: Learn how to manage configuration data and sensitive information like passwords securely using ConfigMaps and Secrets.

Namespaces: Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. Namespaces provide isolation and help organize resources.

Labels and Selectors: Labels are key-value pairs attached to resources, and selectors are used to identify resources based on labels.

Kubectl: Learn the command-line tool kubectl used to interact with Kubernetes clusters, including managing resources, querying the cluster, and debugging.

Kubernetes API: Understand the Kubernetes API and how to interact with it using kubectl or programming languages like Python, Go, etc.

Pod Scheduling: Learn about node selection, node affinity, and anti-affinity to control where pods are scheduled.

Resource Management: Understand how to set resource limits and requests for containers to ensure efficient cluster resource usage.

Autoscaling: Learn about Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler to automatically scale your application based on demand.

Ingress and Ingress Controllers: Learn about how to expose services externally using Ingress and Ingress controllers like Nginx, Traefik, etc.

Monitoring and Logging: Explore various tools and techniques to monitor the health of your Kubernetes cluster and applications.

Security Best Practices: Learn about best practices for securing your Kubernetes cluster, including RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and Network Policies.

Upgrades and Rollbacks: Understand how to upgrade Kubernetes and your applications while ensuring backward compatibility.

Helm: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications.

StatefulSets and DaemonSets: Learn about these advanced resources used for stateful applications and managing daemons across your cluster.
